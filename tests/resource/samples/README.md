# Specimen documents

Made-up identity documents for the tests and demos: a smart ID card (also turned sideways), a
passport data page with a machine readable zone whose check digits agree, and a green ID book page.
The people, numbers and dates are invented, and each is marked "SPECIMEN - NOT A VALID DOCUMENT".

The JPEGs were rendered from the SVGs beside them (in Arial or Helvetica) with the lunasvg-based
`sc::svg2png` of sc-image 3.1 and earlier, and are kept as they are, so the tests read the same
pixels on every machine. sc-image 4 renders SVG without real fonts, so it can't render them again
like for like.

TODO: re-render them once sc-image draws text in real fonts.

Real documents never go in the repository: put them in `tests/resource/private/` (git-ignored),
where the tests that need them - real faces, real photographs - look for them, and skip without.
